# Projected-Projects

Description
This project is intended to be a time keeping program that allows you to save events and color codes times from past, present, and future. Unfortunatly I have really struggled with my health and fell behind. Most of this project remains in the future development stage. I was advised by the teaching staff to just get it turned in despite it not being up to my standards.

Credit
I owe alot to the TA's for this one. I don't know that I could have brought myself to turn in a project as unready as this otherwise. I was advised to just make sure it has some code in it, and get the grade so that I'm not missing too many assignments.
